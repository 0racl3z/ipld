The Vision of IPLD, and our Theory of Change
============================================

IPLD is a project with the long term aim of increasing the amount of technology
which develops based on decentralized, "local-first" principles.

This is a very holistic goal: we want to increase the amount of such technology
by making it easier to write such technology;
by making such technology easier to use and consistently more reliably than its centralized counterparts;
by making it clear that such technology can provide features and possibilities that centralized software simply can't.
We want to make all of these things true in a harmonious self-reinforcing cycle of ecosystemic growth,
where continuing development of decentralized local-first technologies makes
more development of *even more* decentralized local-first technologies more appealing.


What is a Theory of Change?
---------------------------

A Theory of Change is an understanding that some of our goals are very long term.
We can't work on all of them directly: in many cases we have to plan for more reachable intermediate goals,
identify ways to know we've reached those, and plan actions that lead to those intermediate goals;
in other cases, it means we aren't pursuing goals directly at all, but just trying to support
the right _conditions_ for our desired outcomes to be able to emerge.


The IPLD Theory of Change

An Example
----------

One concrete example we use to state our objectives in the IPLD project is this:

> Imagine you want to write the next "git" (or imagine git hadn't been made yet, and you're about to do it).
> Some decentralized project: you know you need content-address data primitives, but haven't written it yet.
>
> The goal of IPLD is to make that take one order of magnitude _less time_ than it otherwise would have.

(Thereafter, we also hope IPLD made that project enduringly easier to debug,
easier to build compatibility stories with other projects,
easier to actually ship the content around,
easier to build long term migration strategies for as the project evolves,
and so on.  But in general: all these things should be *easier* to do with IPLD
in contrast to if you tried to do all these things alone.)
