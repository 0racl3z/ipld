IPLD Schemas
============

IPLD Schemas are an interface definition language which provides a way to do structural typing for data structures.
They're meant to be useful as a _design language_, and meant to make specifying protocols easier -- especially, decentralized protocols.

:::info
This is a _docs_ chapter, contrasted with a _specs_ chapter -- if you want more mechanical details
(including, especially, the schema-schema!),
you may prefer to jump over to [Schemas in the specs chapters](/specs/schemas/) instead.
:::

We have materials in this chapter of the documentation for overviews on what Schemas are, what makes them unique,
how to use them, and, how to use them _effectively_.
