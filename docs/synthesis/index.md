Putting it All Together
=======================

The IPLD ecosystem contains a lot of complex concepts and many different pieces of software
and data standards interacting.  It can be hard to know which concepts to apply where.

In this chapter of the documentation, we'll try to provide some "rules of thumb" for what to do.
We'll also provide some rich real-world examples of how systems have been built with IPLD,
which might be useful inspirations for your own work.
