        URLs give no guarantees that the data we receive
        hasn't been compromised. The IPLD naming system
        ensures that no one can lie about the data they
        are serving.

        A domainâ€™s owner is the only one who can serve you content.
        With IPLD, anyone who has the data helps with distributing
        it, too.

    - name: "Immutable Content"
      icon: "social.svg"
      description: |
        The content behind URLs can change or disappear,
        making our links broken or not pointing anymore
        to what we were expecting. IPLD links cannot mutate
