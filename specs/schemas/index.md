IPLD Schema Specifications
==========================

Here are collected the specifications and fixtures for IPLD Schemas.

:::info
This is a _specs_ chapter, rather than a _docs_ chapter.  It's geared for in-depth details.

For more introductory and human-friendly material on Schemas -- what they are, what they do, and how to use them -- see [Schemas in the docs chapters](/docs/schemas/) instead.)
:::

The IPLD Schema specification is self-hosting: it is primarily described by the "schema schema".

- The schema-schema can be seen in two forms, in DSL form, or as the equivalent parsed Schema DMT in JSON encoding:
	- [schema-schema.ipldsch](./schema-schema.ipldsch)
	- [schema-schema.ipldsch.json](./schema-schema.ipldsch.json)

Additional material:

- Examples:
	- An example Schema, in DSL form, with matching parsed Schema DMT in JSON encoding:
		- [examples.ipldsch](./examples.ipldsch)
		- [examples.ipldsch.json](./examples.ipldsch.json)
- Fixtures:
	- Aside from the schema-schema and examples above, more fixtures for this system are currently lacking.  If you know of some and can link them here, or are willing to write some, please send an issue or PR.
