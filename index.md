IPLD
====

Welcome to the internet of data structures!


What is IPLD?
-------------

IPLD stands for **I**nter**P**lanetary **L**inked **D**ata.

IPLD is an ecosystem of formats and data structures for building applications
that can be fully decentralized.

The goal of IPLD is to enable decentralized data structures that are universally addressable and linkable,
which in turn will enable more decentralized applications.
These addressable and linkable data structures will allow us to do for data what URLs and links did for HTML web pages.

We say IPLD is an ecosystem, rather than a project or a library,
becaseu this ecosystem is held together by a few concepts and
standards that ensure compatibility between formats and programming languages.

You'll find numerous libraries for working with IPLD.
You may even create a few of your own.
That library is part of the IPLD ecosystem and you're now a part of its community.
You don't need to be a committer in a repository in the IPLD GitHub org to be a part of this community;
you're already almost there just by reading this far.
