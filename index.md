IPLD
====

Welcome to the internet of data structures!


What is IPLD?
-------------

IPLD stands for **I**nter**P**lanetary **L**inked **D**ata.

IPLD is an ecosystem of formats and data structures for building applications
that can be fully decentralized.

We say IPLD is an ecosystem, rather than a project or a library,
becaseu this ecosystem is held together by a few concepts and
standards that ensure compatibility between formats and programming languages.

You'll find numerous libraries for working with IPLD.
You may even create a few of your own.
That library is part of the IPLD ecosystem and you're now a part of its community.
You don't need to be a committer in a repository in the IPLD GitHub org to be a part of this community;
you're already almost there just by reading this far.
