> Official website for IPLD http://ipld.io

This repository contains the source code for the IPLD website available at http://ipld.io

This project builds out a static site to explain IPLD, ready for deployment on ipfs. It uses `hugo` to glue the html together. It provides an informative, public-facing website. The most important things are the words, concepts and links it presents.

The implementation aims to progressively enhance the content. The styling is done with [tachyons](http://tachyons.io/) to keep things light. The animations are done in SVG and CSS. There is very little JavaScript and the interactive elements that use JS should degrade gracefully on browsers without it.
