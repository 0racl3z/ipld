IPLD
====

Welcome!

This repository is the entrypoint to the IPLD project:
documentation, specifications, the website, and a great deal of the design work all live here.

IPLD stands for "**I**nter**P**lanetary **L**inked **D**ata,
and is a series of standards and formats for describing data in a content-addressing-emphatic way.
The people who work on IPLD do so because we want a world where it's easy to build decentralized, distributed, and inter-operable applications,
and we believe robust data formats and a clear story for content-addressing them is a key piece of leverage towards that goal.
