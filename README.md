# The ipld.io website

A static site to show you that IPLD is a thing, and a good one at that.

## Getting started

- Install `hugo`. (`brew install hugo` on OSX)
- From the root of the project run the hot-reloading dev-server

```sh
hugo server -ws .
```

Open http://localhost:1313 in your browser & `content/index.html` in your editor.
